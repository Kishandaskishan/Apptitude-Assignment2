1. What quantity of water should be added to the milk water mixture so that
the milk water ratio changes from 2:3 to 4:11. The quantity of milk in the
mixture is 40 litres?

Ans.     Let the quantity of water in the mixture be "w" litres. Then, the total quantity of the mixture is 40 + w litres.

The initial ratio of milk to water in the mixture is 2:3, so the ratio of the quantity of milk to the quantity of water is 2/(2+3)=2/5.

The final ratio of milk to water in the mixture should be 4:11, so the ratio of the quantity of milk to the quantity of water should be 4/(4+11)=4/15.

So, we can write the following equation to find the quantity of water that should be added:
(40 / (40 + w)) / (2/5) = (40 + w) / (4/15)

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
40 / (40 + w) = (40 + w) * (2/5) / (4/15)
40 / (40 + w) = (40 + w) * (3/5) / (4/5)
40 * (4/5) = (40 + w) * (3/5)
160 = (40 + w) * (3/5)
160 / (3/5) = (40 + w)
160 * (5/3) = 40 + w
533.33 = 40 + w
w = 533.33 - 40
w = 493.33

So, 493.33 litres of water should be added to the mixture to change the milk to water ratio from 2:3 to 4:11.


2. Linear equation 2x+3y=0 meets the x & y-axis at the point?

Ans.  The equation 2x + 3y = 0 is a linear equation in the form y = -(2/3)x + b, where b is the y-intercept.

The x-intercept occurs when y = 0, so substituting y = 0 into the equation we get:

2x + 3 * 0 = 0
2x = 0
x = 0

So, the x-intercept is (0,0).

The y-intercept occurs when x = 0, so substituting x = 0 into the equation we get:

2 * 0 + 3y = 0
3y = 0
y = 0

So, the y-intercept is (0,0).

Therefore, the line represented by the equation 2x + 3y = 0 meets both the x and y-axis at the point (0,0).

3. a & b are positive integers such that a^2-b^=19. Find a & b?

Ans.  The equation a^2 - b^2 = 19 can be factored as (a + b)(a - b) = 19. Since both a and b are positive integers, the only factor pairs of 19 that result in positive integers are (1,19) and (19,1).

So, a + b = 1 or 19 and a - b = 19 or 1.

For the first case, where a + b = 1, we have the equations:
a + b = 1
a - b = 19

Adding these two equations, we get 2a = 20, so a = 10. Substituting this into either of the equations we found, we get:

b = 1 - a
b = 1 - 10
b = -9

Since b is a positive integer, this solution is not valid.

For the second case, where a + b = 19, we have the equations:
a + b = 19
a - b = 1

Adding these two equations, we get 2a = 20, so a = 10. Substituting this into either of the equations we found, we get:

b = 19 - a
b = 19 - 10
b = 9

Since both a and b are positive integers, the solution is a = 10 and b = 9.


4. Find a^+b^3+c^3+3abc , where a+b+c=5 & , a^2+b^2+c^2=10?

Ans. We can use the equations a + b + c = 5 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 10 to find the values of a, b, and c.

From the first equation, we have:
c = 5 - (a + b)

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
a^2 + b^2 + (5 - (a + b))^2 = 10
a^2 + b^2 + 25 - 10a - 10b + a^2 + b^2 = 10
25 - 10a - 10b = -15
10a + 10b = 40
a + b = 4

Since a and b are positive integers, the only solution is a = 1 and b = 3. Substituting these values into the equation c = 5 - (a + b), we get:

c = 5 - (1 + 3)
c = 5 - 4
c = 1

Now that we have the values of a, b, and c, we can substitute them into the expression a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3abc to get the result:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3abc = 1^3 + 3^3 + 1^3 + 3 * 1 * 3 * 1 = 1 + 27 + 1 + 27 = 56

So, the expression a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3abc is equal to 56.

5. Sum of two, two-digit numbers is a perfect square. The digits of the first
two-digit number are two consecutive positive integers; also, when the digits
of the first number are reversed, the second number is formed. Find these
numbers & the square root of their sum.?

Ans .  Let's consider the two-digit number AB, where A and B are two consecutive positive integers. The second number is then BA. The sum of these two numbers is AB + BA = 11A.

We know that the sum must be a perfect square, so we can write:
11A = N^2
A = N^2 / 11

Since A is a positive integer, we need to find the smallest value of N such that N^2 / 11 is a positive integer. The smallest value of N that satisfies this condition is N = 11, which gives A = 1. The two numbers are then 11 and 11. The square root of their sum is 11.

So the two two-digit numbers are 11 and 11, and the square root of their sum is 11.
